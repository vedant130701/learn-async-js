Explain the code execution based on the order of the messages logged in src/quiz/promise-2darray.txt.

Both sumPromise1 and sumPromise2 are promises, so they work asynchrounously. 
So the execution order of console.log statements in both are not in any set order, they can appear
in any order between themselves. Since we are using setTimeout(), it wil make array sum calculation
asynchrounous. 
Promise 2 gets rejected before Promise 1 resolve, and promise 1 takes more time to execute. Hence 
the rejection by promise 2 comes before promise 1.
